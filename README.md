# Hyper Solutions — Codex Plugin

A [Codex plugin](https://developers.openai.com/codex/plugins/build) that teaches Codex to
**integrate and debug** the **Hyper Solutions** anti-bot API (Akamai, Incapsula,
DataDome, Kasada) across the Go, Python, and JavaScript/TypeScript SDKs and the raw REST
API — and to **debug failing requests** by inspecting captured traffic.

It bundles two things:
1. A **skill** (`skills/hypersolutions/SKILL.md` + `references/`) with the full
   integration + debugging playbook, including a **request-fingerprinting principles**
   reference (`references/request-rules.md`) for spotting the mistakes that get
   request-based bots blocked (the exhaustive, always-current checks run in the
   har-analyzer MCP below).
2. Two **MCP servers** (`.mcp.json`):
   - **powhttp** — inspect your script's real wire traffic (header order + TLS
     fingerprint) live and apply those rules to it.
   - **har-analyzer** — a hosted server that runs the same rule set against an exported
     **HAR** and returns structured findings (`analyze_har`).

Ask Codex things like:
- "Help me set up the Akamai sensor flow in Python with tls-client."
- "My DataDome slider solve returns 403 — capture my script with powhttp and tell me what's wrong."
- "Analyze my captured requests and find why I'm getting blocked."
- "Why is my `_abck` cookie never becoming valid?"

## Install

Requires the [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex) (`npm install -g @openai/codex`).
Register this repo as a marketplace, then install the plugin — skill and both MCP servers:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add Hyper-Solutions/hypersolutions-codex
codex plugin add hypersolutions@hypersolutions
```

The `har-analyzer` MCP server is OAuth-protected, so authenticate it once (a browser opens
for a Hyper Solutions sign-in):

```bash
codex mcp login har-analyzer
```

Restart the Codex app afterward. The plugin then appears under **Settings → Plugins**, and
its `powhttp` and `har-analyzer` servers under **MCP servers → From plugins** (you can also
authenticate `har-analyzer` from there instead of the CLI). The skill auto-activates when
your prompt matches Hyper Solutions / anti-bot integration or request-debugging work (see
the `description` in `skills/hypersolutions/SKILL.md`).

> The `codex plugin` commands are the first-party install path. The npm `codex-marketplace`
> tool registers the files but does **not** complete the native install, so the runtime
> never enables the plugin — use the commands above.

### Development

To work on the plugin from a local checkout, add the repo directory as the marketplace
source instead of the GitHub one:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hyper-Solutions/hypersolutions-codex.git
codex plugin marketplace add ./hypersolutions-codex
codex plugin add hypersolutions@hypersolutions
```

The bundled `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` uses `source: local` with `path: "."`, so
the repo root is the plugin. Re-run `codex plugin add` (or `codex plugin marketplace upgrade`)
after editing to pick up changes.

## Using the powhttp request debugger

The bundled MCP (`.mcp.json`) points at powhttp's local MCP server
(`http://localhost:8383/mcp`). To use it:

1. Install and run [powhttp](https://powhttp.com); click **"Run MCP server"**.
2. Route your failing script's traffic through powhttp's proxy (`http://127.0.0.1:8080`)
   and run the flow.
3. Ask Codex to debug it — it will query the captured requests via the `powhttp` MCP
   tools and analyze header order, TLS fingerprint, cookies, and client hints.

If powhttp isn't running the MCP simply has no tools available; you can still analyze a
HAR the user exports by applying the same rules. See `references/powhttp-mcp.md` and
`references/request-rules.md`.

## Using the HAR analyzer

The bundled `har-analyzer` MCP (`.mcp.json`) is a **hosted** server
(`https://har-mcp.hypersolutions.co/mcp`) that runs the Hyper Solutions fingerprint rule
set against an exported HAR. It's the fastest way to triage a HAR a customer sends you.

Ask Codex to analyze a `.har` file — it calls the `analyze_har` tool and reports the
findings (severity, category, fix) plus the detected anti-bot product. The `har-analyzer`
server is OAuth-protected: the first time, authenticate it in Codex (click **Authenticate**
on the server, or run `codex mcp login har-analyzer`) and sign in with your Hyper Solutions
account. No API key needed.

A HAR lacks the true wire header order and TLS fingerprint, so a clean result doesn't
rule out those — prefer powhttp for the live wire. See `references/har-analyzer-mcp.md`.

## Maintaining this plugin (IP boundary)

Everything shipped in this repo is **public** — a marketplace reader sees it without an API
key. Keep the valuable, evolving detection logic out of it. The rule when editing:

- **Static files** (`SKILL.md`, `references/`, `scripts/`) hold only **how to use the API**
  and **generally-known** browser-fingerprinting facts (header order, sec-ch-ua GREASE,
  public cookie/endpoint names). This is documentation, not the moat.
- **The har-analyzer MCP** (server-side) holds the **exhaustive and
  current** detection rules — exact thresholds, per-product flow checks, anything that
  changes as detection evolves. New or updated detection logic goes **there, not here**.
- Don't add: reverse-engineering of an anti-bot's internals (obfuscation/VM/payload
  generation), exact internal thresholds, or named customer/target apps. Describe formats
  generically and point users to Hyper Solutions for specifics.

When in doubt: if it teaches someone to *use* the API, it can live here; if it reveals what
HS *knows or checks*, it belongs in the MCP.
